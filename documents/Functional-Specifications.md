## Synthetizer and how it works?

A **synthesizer** is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. Synthesizers typically create sounds by generating waveforms. These waves may be altered by components such as filters that cut or boost frequencies, envelopes that control articulation or how notes begin and end, and low-frequency oscillators, which modulate parameters such as pitch or volume. Synthesizers are typically played with keyboards or controlled by sequencers, software or other instruments, and can be synchronized to other equipment via MIDI.

For our project, we are in the case of Software synthesizers.

## Project Target

A developer who wants to use a library for playing with sound synthesis, creating music or sounds.
